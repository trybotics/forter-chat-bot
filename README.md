# Create a chatbot for the assignment.

Your challenge is to build a chatbot web app.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è TASK
Implement a chat application where each user can post questions & answers in a chat room. We would also want for you to feature one  special member to that room - an awesome bot which should answer questions that were already answered before.

## ‚öôÔ∏è REQUIREMENTS
- The application should be a single page which should focus on the chat room itself (no authentication, etc).
- Use the following application skeleton based on node.js and lit. You are allowed to use any additional libraries.

## ‚ùó PAY ATTENTION TO
Your challenge is to implement the above while thinking of the following:
- ü§ñ Core functionality - This is what the task is all about! Making a chat room with a bot. Remember how it must be able to answer questions which were already answered.
- üé® Beautiful UI - Impress us with a breathtaking UI, you are welcome to use any library you want. We recommend checking Dribbble and Codepen as well as taking inspiration from everyday chats apps.
- üß± Code Structure & Edge Cases - Think of how to structure the code so it would be robust and that you will be proud to present to us.



## üí∞ BONUS
- Use ElasticSearch as a database and use smarter queries to find better matches for similar questions that were answered before. 
- We would appreciate a bot with an attitude - one that could make others laugh - an entertaining AI experience.
- Creativity & Microinteractions - Think which features would enhance the users‚Äô stay on the website and what microinteraction gestures could help.
